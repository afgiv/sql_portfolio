 Model:       stg_order_reviews.sql
 Purpose:     Clean and standardize raw order review data.
 Author:      Amadeo F. Genio IV
 Description: 
   - Removes duplicate records from the raw dataset.
   - Renames columns for clarity (e.g., review_score â†’ score).
   - Captures both timestamps:
       * date_submitted = when the customer created the review.
       * date_processed = when the platform system recorded it.
 Notes:
   - Use `date_processed` as the reliable review timestamp for analysis.
   - Keep `date_submitted` for latency checks between submission 
     and system processing.
